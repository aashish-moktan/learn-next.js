### What is Project Colocation?

Project colocation is a concept in Next.js that says the files can be located inside the project and cannot be accessed from outside.

For example:

The file page.tsx for any given route can be accessed from outside but the same folder may contain other files within that folder that cannot be accessed from outside.
